Unity Game Project :
It's a roguelike 4 player local coop adventure game where you beat levels as satirical fantasy characters. In this game every action has great repercussions on your teammates so communication and learning is encouraged.
This endless project also servers as a learning platform for me.

Building this i learnt, 
- Fragment Shaders (Unity and GLSL),
- OOP based game programming,
- Problem solving,
- and more!

Here are some screenshots from the game!
